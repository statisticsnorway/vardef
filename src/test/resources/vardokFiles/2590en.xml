        <dc:description>A collection of houses where the distance between each house does not exceed 50 metres. For large buildings, including blocks of flats, offices, warehouses, industrial buildings and sports grounds, the distance can be up to 200 metres to one of the houses in the collection. A collection of houses with at least five buildings, which is located less than 400 metres outside the demarcation described between first and second dot, must be included in the agglomeration. The demarcation of an agglomeration is independent of municipality and county boundaries. If waste water from two or more agglomerations, as mentioned in the first paragraph, is collected and sent to a common waste water treatment plant or discharge site, the agglomerations are regarded as one agglomeration.</dc:description>
